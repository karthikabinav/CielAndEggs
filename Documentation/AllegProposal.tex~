    Our project is a game which we call the \footnotemark'Ciel and the Eggs'.
It is a game where a set of hens sitting on a wire drop eggs randomly and a person called 'Ciel' collects eggs in a basket. He gets points for catching the eggs and loses the games if he drops 7 eggs overall in the game.

\section{Project Idea}
    There will be a opening screen, where the user selects to play. The whole game screen contains two wires initially and hens sitting on them. They randomly drop eggs and the user should move 'Ciel' around and catch the eggs. The hens drop two kinds of eggs and sometimes do malicious activities like dropping posinous egg. The two kinds of eggs are normal egg and golden egg. The normal egg is 1 point and golden egg is 2 points. Catching the poison gives negative 1 points.
\section{Code base}
    
    The Basic driver to the entire game is contained in the file controller.asm, which inturn uses three major files in the backend, namely :
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    static.inc : This contains the procedures to draw various static objects on screen like,hen,wires,basket,etc.This takes the design in the form of .txt file and reproduces the exact same design on the screen.
    \item
    proc.inc : This contains the collection of variety of proceudres used during the logic of the game like collision detection, printing numbers,etc
    \item
    Data.inc : This contains the memory allocation to various global variables used throughout the game
    \end{itemize}
    
        Besides the above major files, there are other files which does certain independent tasks, namely:
        \begin{itemize}
           \item
            screen/gameover.inc : This displays the gameover splash 
            \item
            screen/home.inc : This displays the Homepage on starting the game
            \item
            sound/break.inc : This generates the sound when a egg is broken
            \item
            sound/catch.inc : This generates the sound when a egg is caught
        \end{itemize}
